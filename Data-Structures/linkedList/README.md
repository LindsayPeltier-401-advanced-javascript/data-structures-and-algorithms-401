# Linked Lists

Create a linked list, search to see if a specific value is present, and return a string of all values in the list.

## Challenge

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

*Create a node class with the properties of 'value' and 'next' which connects to the next node
*Create a LinkedList class, include a head property.
*Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
*Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
*Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
*Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
*Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
  .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
  .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
  .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
